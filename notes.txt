This is repository which consists of my learning related to basics of docker and kubernetes.
This is the source youtube video from which I had learnt the docker basics.

All the containers will be running locally (Mostly on the PC which I had used at that time) and not on any cloud Providers

This tutorial introduces to the term microservices and lists down it benefits and downsides

cloud Native:
Cloud Native uses Containers,microservices,service meshes, immutable infrastructure and declarative APIs

Container:
Container is the first building block of Cloud Native architecture.
It is a unit of Software / deployment.It consists Code, Runtime, System tools and System libraries.

Why Containers?
- Move faster by deploying smaller units 
- use fewer resources
- Fit more into the same host
- Faster automation
- portability
- isolation

Difference between VM's and Containers explained by Geeksforgeeks => https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-virtual-machines-and-containers/

Containers are made of three layers:
- Application (Read or Write)
- Customization (Read only)
- Base OS(Windows or Linux)(Read only)

Container registry services are like Github for Containers.
Contains Container images.

If there are more than one Container present in a given system, Container Orchestrators are used for the following reasons
- Manage 
  - Infrastructure
  - Containers
  - Deployment
  - Scaling
  - Failover
  - Health monitoring
  - App upgrades, Zero-Downtime
- Install your own
  - Kubernetes, Swarm, Service Fabric
- Orchestrators as a service (These are given by cloud providers)
  - Azure Kubernetes Service, Service Fabric

What is Docker?? 
Docker is 
- the company
- the platform
- Open container initiative (Runtime and image specs)
- moby project (Container runtime)
- Mirantis (Company which acquired Docker Enterprise in 2019 and They are in charge of Docker Certification)


- An open source container runtime
- Mac, Windows & Linux Support
- Command line tool
- "Dockerfile" file format for building container images
- Windows let you run Both Windows and Linux Containers

Tip: Restart when else or docker fails

Docker desktop is beginner-friendly. I was using Windows 11 along with WSL.

Some Docker Commands
- docker info => Display system information
- docker version => Display the system's version
- docker login => Log in to a Docker registry
